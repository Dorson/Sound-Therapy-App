1.  **Select a Preset:** Choose a pre-configured session from the dropdown menu that matches your goal (e.g., "Focus", "Deep Sleep").
2.  **Customize (Optional):**
    *   Use the **Session Length** slider to set the duration.
    *   Adjust the **Effects Intensity** slider to control the volume of the ambient layers.
    -   Toggle the **SoundScape Layer Effects** on or off to fine-tune your sound.
3.  **Play:** Press the "Play" button to begin your session.

## üß† Sound Therapy Explained

This app uses a technique called **brainwave entrainment**. By playing two slightly different frequencies in each ear, the brain perceives a third "beat" at the frequency difference between the two. This is the **binaural beat**. Different beat frequencies are associated with different mental states:

-   **Delta (0.5-4 Hz):** Deep, dreamless sleep, restorative processes.
-   **Theta (4-8 Hz):** Deep meditation, REM sleep, creativity.
-   **Alpha (8-12 Hz):** Relaxed awareness, mindfulness, light meditation.
-   **Beta (12-30 Hz):** Active thinking, focus, concentration.
-   **Gamma (30-100 Hz):** High-level cognitive processing, peak awareness.

Each **SoundScape Layer Effect** is designed to complement this process, masking external noise and adding texture to guide your mind. You can read detailed explanations for each effect within the app itself.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

This project is a showcase of modern, framework-free web development.

-   **Architecture:** The codebase is split into a modular architecture using ES6 Modules (`index.js`, `soundEngine.js`, `ui.js`, `presets.js`) to maintain a clean separation of concerns.
-   **Core Technology:** 100% Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3.
-   **Audio Generation:** All sound is generated in real-time using the **Web Audio API**. This includes oscillators, gain nodes, filters, stereo panners, and a convolver for reverb. Complex looping sounds like the Shamanic Drum are pre-rendered into an `AudioBuffer` for performance.
-   **Offline First:** Designed to run directly from the file system without needing a web server. All logic is client-side.
-   **AI-Free:** The app relies on carefully curated presets based on established principles of sound therapy, with no generative AI integration.

### How to Run Locally

Since this is a dependency-free project, you can run it without any build steps:

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
