# App Architecture Conversion TODO

This file tracks the process of converting the application from a single-file architecture to a modern, modular one.

- [x] Refactor the large `appController` object in `index.js` into smaller, more focused modules (e.g., `ui.js`, `soundEngine.js`, `presets.js`). Use ES6 `import`/`export` statements to manage dependencies between them. This has significantly improved maintainability.
- [ ] Further modularize UI components and event handling to improve separation of concerns.
