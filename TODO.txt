# TODO: Future Enhancements

## Phase 5: Advanced Spatialization and Environment Modeling

- Research and implement more advanced stereo panning and spatialization techniques to create a more immersive 3D sound field.
- Explore adding dynamic environment simulation (e.g., reverb size changing based on stage) to enhance the sense of space.

## Phase 6: Psychoacoustic Expansion - "DMT Release Sound Therapy"

This phase focuses on creating a new, advanced preset based on neuroscientific findings related to DMT experiences. The goal is to simulate the dynamic shifts in brainwave activity (Alpha suppression, Theta/Delta/Gamma increase) for therapeutic and explorative purposes.

### Step 1: Research & Parameter Mapping
- **Action:** Analyze scientific literature on EEG readings during endogenous/exogenous DMT states.
- **Goal:** Map key findings (e.g., alpha power drop, theta/gamma power surge, "carrier hum") to the app's available sound parameters (`base`, `beat`, `padCut`, effect toggles, etc.).

### Step 2: Sound Design & Wavetable Creation
- **Action:** Design a new, unique wavetable for the carrier oscillator used in this preset. The sound should be less "clean" than the current sine-based one, perhaps with more complex, slightly dissonant harmonics to represent the "vibrational" aspect of the experience.
- **Goal:** Create a `dmtCarrierWavetable` in `wavetables.js` that can be loaded by the `WaveformCoreProcessor`.

### Step 3: Multi-Stage Preset Implementation
- **Action:** Create a new preset object named `dmt_release` in `presets.js`. This preset will have multiple stages to model the typical progression of the experience.
- **Goal:** Define at least 4 stages:
    1.  **Onset:** Simulates the initial "rush" with a rising carrier frequency and intense vibrational effects. Utilize the `resonantPulse` effect.
    2.  **Immersion:** Characterized by suppressed Alpha waves and a deep Theta/Delta state. Soundscape should be spacious and atmospheric.
    3.  **Peak:** Introduce high-frequency Gamma entrainment (40Hz+ beat) layered over the deep Theta state. The soundscape should be complex, intricate, and dynamic.
    4.  **Re-entry:** A gradual return to a calm, integrative Alpha state. Frequencies descend and complexity reduces.

### Step 4: UI & Documentation Update
- **Action:** Add the preset description to `presets.js`, ensuring it has a clear, responsible explanation and a strong cautionary note about its intensity. The UI will automatically pick it up from there.
- **Goal:** Ensure the user understands what the preset is, how to use it safely, and what to expect.

### Step 5: Testing & Refinement
- **Action:** Conduct thorough listening tests to balance the intensity of the effects.
- **Goal:** Ensure the preset is powerful but not jarring or uncomfortable. Adjust gain levels, ramp times, and frequencies for a smooth, effective, and safe psychoacoustic journey.
