# App Architecture Conversion TODO

This file tracks the process of converting the application from a single-file architecture to a modern, modular one.

- [ ] Implement more robust error handling in the sound engine to prevent audio context failures from crashing the app and ensure graceful degradation.
- [ ] Review and enhance PWA offline capabilities by creating a dedicated fallback, and fail safe service worker to ensure all assets are cached correctly for maximum resilience. if the web workers ar enot supported , we should fall back to supportedmethods.
- [ ] Create a simple, custom event bus to fully decouple modules and eliminate the need for passing controller callbacks.
